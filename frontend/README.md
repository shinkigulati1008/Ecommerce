# Shinki Trends E-Commerce Platform

This project consists of three main folders, each serving a specific purpose in building a full-fledged e-commerce platform.

## 1. Admin Panel (admin)

The admin panel is built using React and provides functionality for managing products on the platform. Admins can view all products, add new products, and store the data in MongoDB.

### Setup

Navigate to the `admin` folder and run the following commands:

cd admin
npm install
npm start

## 2. Backend API (backend)

The backend is built using Express and provides the necessary APIs for handling product data, user authentication, and more. Key packages installed include CORS, Express, JSONWebToken, Mongoose, and Multer.

### Setup

Navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

cd backend
npm install
npm start

## 2. Frontend E-Commerce Site (frontend)

The frontend of the e-commerce site is built using React and includes features such as user authentication (login/logout), adding products to the cart, and fetching product details from MongoDB.

### Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder and run the following commands:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
